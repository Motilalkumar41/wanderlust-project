# Vacation Rental Management System (Airbnb Clone)

## Overview

Vacation Rental Management System is a web-based property rental and selling platform that allows users to explore, list, and manage properties online. The platform simplifies the process of finding homes for rent or sale while enabling property owners to showcase their properties with detailed information. The system provides a centralized environment where users can browse property listings, view details, and manage listings efficiently.
